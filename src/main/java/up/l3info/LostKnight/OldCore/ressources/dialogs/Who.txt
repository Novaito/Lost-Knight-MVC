Who are you?
I am Who. 
I am like you.
I woke up suddenly, without remembering anything. I was cold, and the villagers didn't want me.
I climbed up the castle and made a hole in the ceiling. I fell and lost consciousness.
I regained consciousness here. Every morning I have food without seeing anyone bring it to me.
I'm warm, I have food, it's the good life, isn't it?
*Is he crazy ????*
